# JSL01 Challenge ‚Äì Solution Code

## Overview

This repository provides the **official solution code for the JSL01 challenge**. It is intended to support students who have completed the challenge and need a reference for improving their work before progressing to **JSL02**.

Students should use this solution to:

- Review and reflect on their own implementation
- Identify areas of improvement in their code (naming, logic, layout, responsiveness, etc.)
- Apply corrections and best practices before continuing with the next challenge in the series

## Structure

The project includes:

- ‚úÖ A fully working solution to the JSL01 challenge
- üìÅ Organised files including `index.html`, `styles.css`, and assets forlder
- üéØ Clean, semantic HTML and well-commented code for ease of understanding
- üìê Responsive layout and accessible design considerations

## How to Use This Solution

1. **Compare** your original solution to the files in this repository.
2. **Make notes** of differences, especially where your solution didn‚Äôt work or used less efficient logic.
3. **Update your project** using this solution as a reference‚Äînot just a copy.
4. Once confident with your corrections, **move on to the JSL02 challenge**.

## Next Steps

After updating your JSL01 project with improvements based on this solution:

‚û°Ô∏è Proceed to **JSL02**, where you'll begin a **new repository**.

- Start by copying your **corrected `index.html` and `styles.css` files** from JSL01 into the new JSL02 repo.
- Then, begin adding the **new JavaScript functionality** required in the JSL02 challenge.
- This ensures your JSL02 project builds on clean, working foundations from JSL01.

### üí° Tip for Students

Don‚Äôt just copy-paste the solution. Try to understand **why** each part of the code works. The goal is to learn how to structure clean, maintainable, and functional JavaScript code.
